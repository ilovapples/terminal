# Terminal
Terminal allows you to log into seperate accounts and access seperate files and use around seven different console commands.

## Update (March 10th, 2023):
### At this point in time, the `terminal.py` script has been set to automatically run the scripts to get the directory, so unless you want to, all of the below information is technically useless. Just thought I'd tell you before you wasted time reading it, like I wasted time writing it.

### Set `dir.txt`
You have to set the `dir.txt` file to the directory that your `terminal.py` file is in.
Thankfully, there is a tool to make that work. You can just run your operating system's version of the `set_dir` script.

 - #### On Windows:
   - In File Explorer:
     1. Navigate to the `Code/terminal` section of the repository on your computer.
     2. Double click the `set_dir.bat` file, or right-click and click 'Open'.
 
   - In Terminal:
     1. Navigate to the `Code/terminal` section of the repository on your computer.
     2. Run the `set_dir.bat` command.

 - #### On Linux/MacOS:
   - In Finder (MacOS)/GUI Based File Viewer (Linux):
     1. Navigate to the `Code/terminal` section of the repository on your computer.
     2. Double click the `set_dir.sh` file, or right-click and click 'Open'.
 
   - In Terminal:
     1. Navigate to the `Code/terminal` section of the repository on your computer.
     2. Run the `bash set_dir.sh` command.

### The program **_WILL NOT_** work properly without the `dir.txt` file being set.
